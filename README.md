**A four-step guide: create the USB, prepare it, install Tahoe, then set up booting without the USB.**

For the **mid-2014 15-inch MacBook Pro (MacBookPro11,3)** with Intel Iris Pro and NVIDIA GT 750M. Supports **Tahoe 26.7.1 / build 25G241 and OCLP 3.0.0 RC3 only**. The preparation tool stops for a different target model or installer build.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Step 4 is required to boot without the USB in this workflow.**
> Install OpenCore onto the internal drive, then run the finishing tool **on the MacBook before rebooting**. Preparing the USB alone leaves this setup dependent on USB OpenCore.
>
> **Already have a working Tahoe desktop through the USB? Start at [step 4](#4-finish-opencore-on-the-internal-drive). Keep your installed system; you do not need to erase it again for this step.**

## Process overview

| Step | Where | What you do | Ready to continue when… |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[1. Create the USB](#1-create-the-oclp-usb)** | Working Mac | Use OCLP RC3 to create the installer and install USB OpenCore for 11,3. | The USB contains the Tahoe installer and OpenCore. |
| **[2. Prepare the USB](#2-prepare-the-usb)** | Working Mac | Run this repo’s preparation command. | It prints **PASS**; packages, EFI fixes and the finishing tool are ready. |
| **[3. Install Tahoe](#3-install-tahoe-on-the-macbook)** | MacBook Pro | Boot through USB EFI, install Tahoe and complete setup/root patching. | The desktop works while booted through USB OpenCore. |
| **[4. Finish internal OpenCore](#4-finish-opencore-on-the-internal-drive)** | **MacBook Pro** | Install internal OpenCore, then run the finishing tool from the USB. | The desktop works after a restart **with the USB disconnected**. |

**Reported working result:** on 17 October 2026, the owner confirmed completed setup and booting without the USB after the internal finishing step. This is one MacBookPro11,3 result. The newer USB launcher/automatic tools installation has fixture coverage and still needs a fresh hardware test. [Validation details](docs/TESTING.md).

## Before you start

- A working Mac: the MacBook itself or another Mac, such as an iMac.
- **Git and Python 3.9+ on the preparation Mac**, Internet access for missing official packages, and approximately **8 GiB free host storage**. Extra space may be needed for backups.
- An installer USB with enough space; **32 GB** was used for this workflow.
- OCLP **3.0.0 RC3** and the exact Tahoe installer/build above.

If Git/Python requests developer tools on the preparation Mac, run `xcode-select --install`, finish the installation window, then check `git --version` and `python3 --version`. A compiler is unnecessary for normal preparation when Python already works. The MacBook’s USB finishing launcher handles its own missing-tools setup in step 4.

## 1. Create the OCLP USB

**On the working Mac, in OCLP RC3:**

1. Set **Settings → Target Model → MacBookPro11,3**. Keep the other model defaults; Verbose Mode is optional.
2. Choose **Create macOS Installer** and write **Tahoe 26.7.1 / 25G241** to the USB. This erases the USB.
3. Choose **Build and Install OpenCore**, build it, then install onto **the USB’s EFI partition**.

Already created the installer? Select the correct target before building/installing USB OpenCore, then continue to step 2.

## 2. Prepare the USB

**On the working Mac, open Terminal:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrCee/oclp-tahoe-mbp113-usb-preparation.git
cd oclp-tahoe-mbp113-usb-preparation
sudo python3 prepare_usb.py --usb "/Volumes/Install macOS Tahoe"
```

Already cloned this repo? Run `git pull --ff-only` inside its folder, then run the preparation command above. Replace the USB name if yours differs.

The command supplies the verified **RC3 assets and matching KDK packages**, applies the USB’s model/normal-boot fixes, and includes **`MBP113-Finish/finish-install.command`** for step 4. It saves backups and logs and shows download/copy progress. Valid existing packages are reused.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Wait for `PASS: supported USB preparation and report saving complete.`**
> If preparation stops, resolve the reported error and rerun. Rebuilding USB OpenCore can replace the fixes, so run preparation **after** the OCLP build/install.

Once it passes, safely eject the USB and its EFI volume. Package installation on the preparation Mac is unnecessary; the packages are staged for the Tahoe installer. [What the scripts change](docs/REFERENCE.md#what-the-scripts-change).

## 3. Install Tahoe on the MacBook

**On the MacBook Pro, with the prepared USB and charger connected:**

1. Start holding **Option**. Choose **USB EFI Boot**, then **Install macOS Tahoe**.
2. For the reported clean-install route, use Disk Utility to erase the intended **internal macOS target** as **APFS** (and **GUID Partition Map** if erasing the physical drive). **Erasing deletes its contents—back up first.** Keep the prepared USB intact. Quit Disk Utility and install Tahoe onto the internal target.
3. At each restart, boot through **USB EFI Boot**. Select the continuing **macOS Installer** entry while installation is underway, then **Macintosh HD** (or your internal volume’s name) when installation finishes. Avoid starting a new installation from the USB each time.
4. Complete user setup. In OCLP, check **Post-Install Root Patch**, apply required patches it reports, and reboot through USB EFI if needed.

**Checkpoint:** you have a usable Tahoe desktop through the USB. **Continue to step 4 before removing it.** The normal route uses no `repair.sh` step.

## 4. Finish OpenCore on the internal drive

**Required final step: boot without the USB.** Start in the MacBook’s installed Tahoe desktop, booted through the working USB EFI.

1. In **OCLP RC3**, confirm **Target Model → MacBookPro11,3**, choose **Build and Install OpenCore**, then install to the **internal physical drive containing Tahoe → its EFI partition**. Identify the drive by name, capacity and internal status; do not assume a disk number.
2. **Postpone OCLP’s reboot prompt.** Open **`MBP113-Finish` on the USB** and double-click **`finish-install.command`**. Alternatively, run:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash "/Volumes/Install macOS Tahoe/MBP113-Finish/finish-install.command"
   ```

   Replace the USB name if needed and enter the MacBook administrator password when asked. Keep the USB connected and writable until the helper finishes.
3. Require **`PASS: internal EFI configuration verified`**. Then shut down, disconnect the USB, start holding **Option**, and select **internal EFI Boot → Macintosh HD**.
4. Once that works, hold **Control** while selecting the internal EFI entry in Apple’s Option picker to make it the default. Test an ordinary restart **with the USB still disconnected**.

**Success:** the desktop loads without the USB. Keep the USB as a fallback.

The finishing tool runs when you open it; normal preparation installs no USB-mount or login watcher. It reuses **Python 3.9+** when available. If Python is missing, it discovers and installs Apple’s offered stable **Command Line Tools** package automatically, then checks Python again. **No Git or second clone is needed on the MacBook.** Setup and EFI backup/report files stay on the USB. [Tools setup, exact EFI changes and logs](docs/REFERENCE.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Repeat the finishing step after rebuilding internal OpenCore.**
> A fresh OCLP build can replace the model fixes that enabled booting. Post-install root patching and internal OpenCore installation are separate operations.

**If boot fails:** reconnect the USB and boot **USB EFI Boot → Macintosh HD**. Keep the error and logs, then check the [troubleshooting reference](docs/REFERENCE.md#if-something-stops). Keep the installed OS while resolving the boot configuration.

## Checks and logs

Audit a prepared USB without changing its files or permissions:

```bash
sudo python3 prepare_usb.py --usb "/Volumes/Install macOS Tahoe" --check
```

An unmounted EFI may be mounted read-only. See the [reference](docs/REFERENCE.md) for log locations, backups, manual packages, existing clones and older USBs.
